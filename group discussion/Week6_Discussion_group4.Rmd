## Week 6 | Discussion (Group) - Project Group 4

* General section:
  * What does a confidence interval tell us about a population parameter?
    * As a % how confident we have that at most X amount of people. 
  * If we have a 95% confidence interval of [2.5, 3.5] for a population mean, how should we interpret this interval?
    * 
  * How does changing the confidence level (e.g., from 90% to 99%) affect the width of the confidence interval? Why does this happen?
    * It would reduce/lower the width of the confidence interval. Why.....
  * How is the margin of error related to confidence intervals?
    * The margin of error is the mirror of a confidence interval. As confidence increases, the margin of error would decrease. 

* Real-life paper section: (DIVYA)
  * Find a research paper where confidence intervals are used to present findings. Use APA citations.

  * Analyze how well the confidence interval is explained in the report.
    * In the paper the concept of the confidence interval (CI) is explained very clearly and effectively, especially for readers in clinical and applied health fields. The authors begin by defining a CI as a “range of values within which the population value is believed to lie at a given level of statistical confidence”. They go beyond the mathematical definition by emphasizing its practical importance helping clinicians understand not only whether a treatment effect exists but also how precise that estimate is. The explanation is strengthened through a practical example involving ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), which demonstrates how the CI can help determine whether an observed difference is likely to be clinically meaningful. The authors illustrate that a narrow CI (e.g. 5°–8°) indicates a more precise and useful estimate, while a wide CI (e.g.1°–15°) leads to uncertainty and limited decision-making value. They also discuss factors influencing CI width, such as sample size, variability, and confidence level, and caution that even a 95% CI does not guarantee every patient will experience the same result. Overall, the report explains confidence intervals in a thorough, logical, and clinically relevant manner, making a complex statistical concept accessible and meaningful for practitioners.
  * How does the variability of the data impact the confidence interval?
    * According to the paper, the variability of the data has a direct influence on the width of the confidence interval (CI). When there is greater variability in the sample data meaning that participants respond differently to the treatment—the CI becomes wider, indicating less precision in estimating the true population effect. This happens because inconsistent responses among individuals make it harder to determine the actual impact of the intervention. On the other hand, lower variability results in a narrower CI, providing a more precise and reliable estimate of the true effect. The authors state that “variability within the sample indicates that the treatment effect was not consistent among study participants, which can occur when inclusion or exclusion criteria are broad”. Therefore, reducing variability in a study helps produce narrower confidence intervals and allows clinicians to interpret results with greater confidence in their accuracy.
  * What might happen if the confidence interval is too wide to provide meaningful insights?
    * The variability of the data directly affects the width and precision of the confidence interval (CI). According to the paper, when there is greater variability among study participants meaning that individuals respond differently to the intervention the confidence interval becomes wider. This happens because inconsistent responses make it harder to estimate the true population effect with precision. In contrast, when data variability is low, meaning participants respond more uniformly, the CI becomes narrower and provides a more precise estimate of the treatment’s effect. The authors explain that variability within the sample indicates that the treatment effect was not consistent among study participants, which can occur when inclusion or exclusion criteria are broad. They note that wide intervals caused by high variability make it difficult for clinicians to be confident about the actual benefit of an intervention. Thus, minimizing variability through careful study design and participant selection leads to narrower, more useful confidence intervals for clinical decision-making.

* Real-life case study section: (NICK) 
  * Explore a real-life case study where biased sampling led to incorrect conclusions. Use APA citations.
  * What were the consequences, and how could the issue have been avoided?
  * Why is it important to use proper sampling methods in statistics?
  * Discuss the risks of bias in sampling.

* Group dataset section:
  * Describe one of your datasets and research question(s). Use APA citations (where necessary).
  * Select a key variable from this dataset. Describe the variable.
  * Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean of the variable.
  * Discuss how the intervals vary based on changes in sample size, variability, and confidence levels.
  * Discuss how sample size affects the confidence interval width.
  * Is it possible to have a narrow confidence interval with a small sample size?
  * Reflect on the accuracy of using small versus large samples and what role statistical sampling plays in ensuring reliable results.
