## Week 6 | Discussion (Group) - Project Group 4

* General section:
  * What does a confidence interval tell us about a population parameter?
  * If we have a 95% confidence interval of [2.5, 3.5] for a population mean, how should we interpret this interval?
  * How does changing the confidence level (e.g., from 90% to 99%) affect the width of the confidence interval? Why does this happen?
  * How is the margin of error related to confidence intervals?

* Real-life paper section: (DIVYA)
  * Find a research paper where confidence intervals are used to present findings. Use APA citations.
  * Analyze how well the confidence interval is explained in the report.
  * How does the variability of the data impact the confidence interval?
  * What might happen if the confidence interval is too wide to provide meaningful insights?

* Real-life case study section: (NICK) 
  * Explore a real-life case study where biased sampling led to incorrect conclusions. Use APA citations.
  * What were the consequences, and how could the issue have been avoided?
  * Why is it important to use proper sampling methods in statistics?
  * Discuss the risks of bias in sampling.

* Group dataset section:
  * Describe one of your datasets and research question(s). Use APA citations (where necessary).
  * Select a key variable from this dataset. Describe the variable.
  * Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean of the variable.
  * Discuss how the intervals vary based on changes in sample size, variability, and confidence levels.
  * Discuss how sample size affects the confidence interval width.
  * Is it possible to have a narrow confidence interval with a small sample size?
  * Reflect on the accuracy of using small versus large samples and what role statistical sampling plays in ensuring reliable results.
